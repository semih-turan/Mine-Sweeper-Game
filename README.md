## How to play

***Minesweeper*** is a logic puzzle game typically played as a computer game. The objective of the game is to clear all non-mine tiles on a grid-based field without detonating any mines. 

Here are the basic rules of Minesweeper:

**Minefield:** The game is played on a grid-based field. This grid can vary in size, typically ranging from 9x9, 16x16, or 16x30, among others. A minimum grid size of 2x2 can be selected.

**Mines:** At the start of the game, some tiles contain mines. The positions of the mines are randomly determined.

**Player Moves:** In each turn, the player selects and reveals a tile. The revealed tiles provide information to the player.

**Numbers and Empty Spaces:** If a revealed tile contains a number, it indicates the number of mines adjacent to that tile. If a revealed tile does not contain a number and does not hide a mine, it and the adjacent empty tiles are revealed.

**Flagging:** Players can mark a tile by placing a flag on it if they suspect there is a mine. This should be taken into account when opening other tiles. (Flagging is not included in this game.)

**Mine Detection:** If a tile containing a mine is revealed, the game is lost.

**Game Completion:** The game is completed when all non-mine tiles are revealed and all mine tiles are flagged.
